# TypeScript 7

> [!NOTE]
> **Parable fork notice.** This is `parable-work/typescript-go`, a fork of
> [microsoft/typescript-go](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go) (Project Corsa). It exists
> solely to expose the compiler API to Parable's `psgen` TypeScript reader, which drives the
> compiler in-process from the `parable-platform` Go module. See

## Fork policy and upgrade procedure

### What this fork changes

Upstream keeps its entire Go API under `internal/`, which external modules cannot import. This fork
adds a `shim/` re-export layer — and nothing else:

- `shim/<pkg>` packages (`compiler`, `checker`, `ast`, `tsoptions`, `vfs`, `vfs/osvfs`, `bundled`,
  `core`) re-export internal APIs via type aliases (`type Program = compiler.Program`) and var/const
  bindings (`var NewProgram = compiler.NewProgram`). No wrapper logic. The surface is intentionally
  minimal and expands only as `psgen` walker code demands.
- `shim/shim_test.go` is a smoke test that drives the full consumer flow (tsconfig parse → Program
  → type checker → AST walk) through the shim packages only. It is the canary that catches
  upstream API moves during a sync.
- This README section.

**Never touch `internal/`** (or anything else outside the list above) in fork-only commits. That
discipline is what keeps upstream syncs conflict-free.

The module path intentionally remains `github.com/microsoft/typescript-go` so that upstream merges
never conflict on import paths.

### How parable-platform consumes this fork

`parable-platform` imports the shim packages under the upstream module path and redirects the
module to this fork with a `replace` directive pinned to a commit pseudo-version (no tags):

```go
// go.mod
require github.com/microsoft/typescript-go v0.0.0

replace github.com/microsoft/typescript-go => github.com/parable-work/typescript-go v0.0.0-20260610201500-abcdef123456
```

```go
import (
    "github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/shim/compiler"
    "github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/shim/tsoptions"
)
```

To pin a new fork commit: `go mod edit -replace github.com/microsoft/typescript-go=github.com/parable-work/typescript-go@<commit-sha>` then `go mod tidy` (Go resolves the SHA to a pseudo-version).

All Corsa API calls in `parable-platform` stay localized to `utils/psgen/internal/loader/tsreader/`;
nothing else in that repo may import these packages.

### Upgrade procedure (dedicated PR cadence)

Upstream syncs always land as **dedicated PRs** — never mixed with shim surface changes or any
other work:

1. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go.git` (first time only).
2. `git fetch upstream`.
3. Branch from `main`: `git checkout -b upgrade/upstream-YYYYMMDD`.
4. `git merge upstream/main` (or a specific upstream tag/commit when pinning to a release).
   Conflicts should be rare to nonexistent given the fork-change policy above.
5. Fix any shim compile breaks caused by upstream API moves **in the same PR**, keeping the shim a
   pure re-export layer.
6. Verify: `go build ./...` and `go test ./shim/`.
7. Open the PR, merge to `main`.
8. In `parable-platform`, bump the `replace` pseudo-version to the new fork commit — also as its own
   dedicated PR there — and fix any `tsreader` breaks in that PR.

Shim surface expansions (new aliases/bindings demanded by walker code) follow the same rule in
reverse: they are their own small PRs against fork `main` and never ride along with an upstream
sync.

## Preview

A preview build is available on npm as [`@typescript/native-preview`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript/native-preview).

```sh
npm install @typescript/native-preview
npx tsgo # Use this as you would tsc.
```

For TypeScript 7.0 RC and later, the command name is `tsc`.

A preview VS Code extension is [available on the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.native-preview).

To use this, set this in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
    "js/ts.experimental.useTsgo": true
}
```

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS 6.0. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS 6.0 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | done | Done, though `tsconfig` errors may not be as helpful. |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS 6.0. |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS 6.0. Types printback in errors may display differently. |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JSDoc | done | Complete, but intentionally lacking some features. Declaration emit differs greatly, intentionally, to be closer to TS declarations. |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | done | - |
| Emit (JS output) | done | - |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking. Not optimized. |
| Build mode / project references | done | - |
| Incremental build | done | - |
| Language service (LSP) | in progress | Nearly all features implemented. |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka "believed done": We're not currently aware of any deficits or major work left to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven't even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn't bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 6.0, see CHANGES.md.
